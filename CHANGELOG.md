# Changelog

All notable changes to MKV Magic will be documented here. Versions follow
semantic versioning; public release tags are immutable and signed.

## Unreleased

- Establish the native Universal macOS architecture, local-only security
  boundary, deterministic workflow planner, FFprobe normalization, AppKit shell,
  signed manual updater policy, tests, CI, and release automation.
- Add recursive file/folder intake and a unified FFprobe plus MKVToolNix
  inspector for file, codec, track-role, HDR, chapter, attachment, and tag facts.
- Add deterministic media identifiers, an asynchronous inspector UI, secure
  macOS document opening, and partial-failure reporting for batch inspection.
- Add a typed queue lifecycle and fail-closed, versioned job-history store that
  cannot record success before verification and commit.
- Exercise the inspection path with the actual bundled media tools in hosted CI.
- Add the first executable metadata action: preview a zero-transcode segment-title
  edit, choose a new output, edit an APFS working clone with `mkvpropedit`, verify
  all unrelated structure, and commit without replacing the original.
- Replace blocking process waits with race-safe termination callbacks and a
  timeout escalation path after a sequential real-tool regression exposed a
  completed-process hang.
- Persist real edit progress through the fail-closed job lifecycle in a private
  atomic history document, with sanitized messages and no invented security
  bookmark or full media path.
- Make History a lightweight native report with recent-job columns and the
  selected job's complete sanitized lifecycle.
- Add a zero-transcode track editor for names, canonical language tags, default,
  forced, enabled, commentary, accessibility, and original-language flags. It
  addresses tracks by stable Matroska UID and shares the same verified-clone
  transaction and durable history path as segment-title edits.
- Keep macOS history writes atomic and private while removing Foundation's
  unsupported iOS file-protection option after a regression reproduced `EPERM`.
- Keep the AppKit entry point synchronous on the process main thread while the
  command-line bundled-tool verifier runs in its own detached task.
